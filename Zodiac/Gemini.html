<div class="data">	Expressive and quick-witted, Gemini represents two different personalities in one and you will never be sure which one you will face. They are sociable, communicative and ready for fun, with a tendency to suddenly get serious, thoughtful and restless. They are fascinated with the world itself, extremely curious, with a constant feeling that there is not enough time to experience everything they want to see.

The sign of Gemini belongs to the element of Air, accompanying Libra and Aquarius, and this connects it to all aspects of the mind. It is ruled by Mercury, the planet that represents communication, writing, and movement. People born under this Sun sign often have a feeling that their other half is missing, so they are forever seeking new friends, mentors, colleagues and people to talk to.

Gemini's changeable and open mind makes them excellent artists, especially writers and journalists, and their skills and flexibility make them shine in trade, driving and team sports. This is a versatile, inquisitive, fun loving sign, born with a wish to experience everything there is out there, in the world. This makes their character inspiring, and never boring.


Gemini - the Caring Twins There is so much childish innocence in the nature of Gemini, telling their tale of brotherhood, love between best friends and relatives who are entirely different by character, circumstances, physical appearance or upbringing. They are in this world to mend differences and make them feel right, ready to give their life for a brother or a friend. Gemini Love and Sex Fun and always ready for an intellectual challenge, Gemini sees love first through communication and verbal contact, and find it as important as physical contact with their partner. When these two combine, obstacles all seem to fade. Inquisitive and always ready to flirt, a Gemini could spend a lot of time with different lovers until they find the right one who is able to match their intellect and energy. They need excitement, variety and passion, and when they find the right person, a lover, a friend and someone to talk to combined into one, they will be faithful and determined to always treasure their heart. </div>

The biggest challenge for any Gemini's love life is to find an emotion that lasts, especially as they get older and realize that they are already in a repetitive mode of superficial or disappointing bonds. Their personality doesn't allow much depth, for they are on a mission to spread information, not to dig into them and find mistakes, holes, or resolutions. They look at life from a relative perspective of movement, being the one to circle the Sun, moving forwards and backwards from Earth's point of view, never certain of their own direction.

Gemini might make sharp turns, leaving those who love them behind, but there are partners that could follow in their pace, ready to build a loving foundation through time. Find them by choosing signs to match a gemini: </div>

<div class="topicHead">Family and Friends:</div>
<div class="data">	Friends - Those born with their Sun in Gemini are very social and love to spend time with friends and family, especially its younger members. A Gemini has an abundance of social contacts and loves to chat, search for understanding, always looking for strong willed people to communicate with. Without a clear flow of words spoken, they will quickly lose interest in the entire theme of any conversation, and need to stay on the move, feeling inspired and pushed forwards by the information shared.

Family - Family is very important to a Gemini, especially their children once they build a strong emotional bond with them. Lack of stability they show to their partners with their expectations extremely high, don't reflect on family as much, and they seem to have a more modest and calm approach to those he shared a home with. Although responsibilities carried by their family life can stand to be a challenge for their nature, they will find a magical way to be in two places at once, getting everything done just as they are supposed to.</div>

<div class="topicHead">Career and Money:</div>
<div class="data">	In constant need of intellectual stimulation, the most suitable job for a Gemini has to be challenging to their brain. They are skillful, inventive and often very smart, with a need for a dynamic working environment and a lot of social contacts met in the office. The best careers they can choose are those of traders, inventors, writers, orators, preachers and lawyers, but any career that gives them the opportunity to communicate freely while keeping them on the move and busy at all times, is an excellent choice. As if they were created for multitasking, problem solving and bringing new ideas to life, they need a workplace that won't keep them stuck in a routinely, repetitive tasks that don't allow them to shine.

Deciding between practicality and pleasure can be a difficult choice for Gemini. Even though they believe that money is just a necessary evil, most of them will not spend much time thinking where to earn it or how they spent it. They need strong grounding to keep their finances in check and organized, giving them a sense of confidence and security they often don't even know they need.</div>
